While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the Metro bundler. The error message was quite generic, saying something like "Could not resolve module 'react-native' in file 'App.js'.". However, react-native was correctly installed in the project. I tried cleaning the cache and reinstalling packages, but the issue persisted. This problem wasn't consistently reproducible, occurring only after certain code modifications or after a while of development.
