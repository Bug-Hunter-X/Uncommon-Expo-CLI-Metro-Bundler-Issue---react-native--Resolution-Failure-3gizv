// Potential solutions to the 'react-native' resolution issue:

// 1. Ensure 'react-native' is correctly installed and linked.
//    expo install react-native

// 2. Check your Expo and React Native versions for compatibility. 
//    Check the Expo documentation for compatibility issues or upgrade/downgrade as needed.

// 3. Delete the node_modules folder, reinstall node packages, and clear the cache.
//    rm -rf node_modules
//    npm install
//    expo start --clear

// 4. Check package.json to ensure 'react-native' is in the dependencies and peerDependencies.

// 5. If using a custom Metro config, review and ensure correct configuration.

// 6. Try running a 'expo prebuild' before attempting to run the project.

// 7. As a last resort, consider creating a new project and gradually migrating the code to rule out project-specific issues.
